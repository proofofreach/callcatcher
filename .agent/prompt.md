if prd.json is empty, run /prd-builder with brief.md then /ralph-prd-to-json
otherwise pick highest priority story where passes: false

IMPORTANT:
- use standard patterns for unknown development
- run echo 'no tests configured' && echo 'no build configured' after changes
- for UI stories, verify with agent-browser before marking complete
- set passes: true only when fully verified
- commit: feat: [Story ID] - [Title]
- when all stories pass, output LOOP_COMPLETE
